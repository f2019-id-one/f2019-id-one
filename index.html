				<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
					Whenever someone asked me what program I'm taking, I would respond with Interaction Design and Development (or just Interaction Design), and people would either be  confused, or they think I'm lying because they don't think such program would exist. As such, let's look at what the George Brown College website has to say about the program itself:
					<blockquote>Interaction Design is an interdisciplinary field merging design skills such as user experience, interface development and graphic design with coding fundamentals to create meaningful experiences between the user and digital platforms such as social media, websites, wearables and mobile devices.<br><br>
					Modified by the psychological, social, economic and cultural factors that shape our present and future world, this ever-evolving field envisions new ways of human-computer interaction within systems, services, products and spaces across multiple industries.<br><br>
					Throughout the Interaction Design and Development program, students will be expected to address such topics as mixed realities, immersive environments, usability, spatial relations and human factors. Students will engage in research, design, testing and group work to create original interactions in a way that is meaningful and practical.</blockquote><br><br>	
					In short, this program is an interdisciplinary program that merge the design fields with the development and technical fields into one. It is kind of like Graphic Design meets Programming. If that makes any sense...
