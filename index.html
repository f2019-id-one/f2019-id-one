				<h1>Interaction Design and Development program (G103)</h1>
					<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
						<p>The program name is Interaction Design and Development, and the course code is G103. It is part of the School of Design and located at Waterfront Campus (it was previously located at St. James Campus). The program duration is 3 years plus optional 7th semester. The program typically starts either in September or January. Students graduating from this program will receive Ontario College Advanced Diploma.</p>
					<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
						<p>Whenever someone asked me what program I'm taking, I would respond with Interaction Design and Development (or just Interaction Design), and people would either be  confused, or they think I'm lying because they don't think such program would exist. As such, let's look at what the George Brown College website has to say about the program itself:</p>
						<blockquote>Interaction Design is an interdisciplinary field merging design skills such as user experience, interface development and graphic design with coding fundamentals to create meaningful experiences between the user and digital platforms such as social media, websites, wearables and mobile devices.<br><br>
						Modified by the psychological, social, economic and cultural factors that shape our present and future world, this ever-evolving field envisions new ways of human-computer interaction within systems, services, products and spaces across multiple industries.<br><br>
						Throughout the Interaction Design and Development program, students will be expected to address such topics as mixed realities, immersive environments, usability, spatial relations and human factors. Students will engage in research, design, testing and group work to create original interactions in a way that is meaningful and practical.</blockquote>
						<p>In short, this program is an interdisciplinary program that merge the design fields with the development and technical fields into one. It is kind of like Graphic Design meets Programming. If that makes any sense...</p>
					<h2 id="courses">Courses</h2>
						<p>There are 36 required courses a student must take in order to graduate from the program (for a complete list of courses please click <a href="https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/interaction-design-and-development-program-g103/#coursesContent">here</a>), plus one field placement option, which depends on how well a student does in academic performance. There are 31 Interaction Design and Development courses, 5 General Education courses (you can pick two of them), and the aforementioned field placement. All courses are required to be taken before a student can proceed with the next course; basically, a pre-requisite course is required to be taken before one can proceed to the next one.</p>
						<p>Because Interaction Design and Development is an interdisciplinary program, each course caters to multiple fields. For example, branding and strategies relates to graphic design and user experience. However, there are courses, like General Education ones, that are not related to any employment field. For instance, the aforementioned General Education courses, you have to pick a General Education course that is usually not related to any of the program.</p>
						<p>Most of the time, students will heavily rely on autodidactism (basically, it means self-studying) to get ahead in class. If anything, it is basically encouraged in the program. For instance, in one of the courses called 3D Visualization, students are encouraged to watch online video tutorials about Maya, a 3D modelling software, in order to utilize the software properly.</p>	
						<p>Throughout the program, sometimes, the course professors will give you resources to use, in order to help you to succeed.</p>
					<h2 id="careers">Careers and Post-graduate Options</h2>
						<p>Graduates of this program will have acquired the skill needed to be hired at various digital media agency, studios, or department. They can have careers such as Information Architect, Interaction Designer, Mobile Designer, Mobile Developer, 3D Visualization Artist, Motion Designer, User Experience Designer, User Interface Designer, Web Designer, Web Developer, SEO/SEM Specialist.</p>
						<p>Basically, upon completion, this program equips you with the required knowledge that you can apply for virtually to any position in any digital media agency, studios, or department that you want.</p>
					<h2 id="tuition">Tuition and Admission</h2>	
						<p>The tuition for this program is a hefty one: $8,882.00. The fees are also subject to changes for the program, depending on the year you started.</p>
						<p>As for the admission requirements, you must have an Ontario Secondary School Diploma (you have to graduate from high school first), Grade 12 English (either College or University), and an Application Questionnaire.</p>
						<p>The Application Questionnaire is fairly straight forward. It will asks you for your name, address, phone number, email address, education background, work experience, and statement of interest.</p>
					<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
